Dataset is highly imbalanced. 

So, the machine learning algorithms like Logistic regression will misclassify data for rare cases. 

Following approaches are used to deal with this issue. 

1.Random Under Sampling of majority class data
 
2.Random oversampling of minority class data 

3.Cluster based oversampling

4. Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling TechniquE (SMOTE)

Evaluate each classifier using ROC and AUS
